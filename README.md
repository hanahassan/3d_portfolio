## Introduction

This repository features my software carreer including 3D animations that highlight my expertise in React, Three.js, and React Three Fiber to showcase projects and skills, and implemented 3D graphics and animations to integrate 3D models and scenes, enhancing the visual experience for users.
I utilized modern JavaScript (ES6+) features to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code, ensuring the high performance and scalability of the application.
I also designed and optimized the user interface (UI) with responsive layouts ensuring a consistent experience across various devices.
